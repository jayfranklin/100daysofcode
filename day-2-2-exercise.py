# Let's find out the raw BMI   weight/height^2
#  Remember, our input was a string, so we have to convert them to floats since 
#  we could recieve a number with a decimal point. If we used integers here, it
#  would not be very accurate

# Store bmi_raw as an integer
bmi_whole = int(bmi_raw)

# Finally, we print the result
